# Test Assignment "Account Creation Form"

## Description

The project is a simple HTML page with a form for creating an account. When the user clicks the "Create account" button, the form performs data validation:
* all fields must be filled,
* the email address must match the format name@example.com,
* the entered passwords match,
* also, for increased security, I added a password complexity check.

If the input is invalid, an error message is displayed. If it is valid, a success message is displayed. I used a ready-made Material UI component to display error and success messages, which saved time on development and styling.

Adaptive styles were applied using media queries to ensure ease of use on mobile devices.
